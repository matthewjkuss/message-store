# Message Store

A very simple React-based SPA.

Though eventually this app would be dynamic, backend features have not get been written.

A static version of the site is available [here](https://matthewjkuss.github.io/message-store/build/), however the routing is broken (since GitHub pages hosts the content from a subdirectory). Still, it demonstrates how the landing page looks.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
